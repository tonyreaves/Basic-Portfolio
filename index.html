            Before I got into coding, I was a journalist. I started at my hometown newspaper as a cody editor and page designer, before I became a reporter in the Oxford Hills region of Maine, an area so rural most Mainers have never heard of it. Then I moved to a bigger Maine paper where I worked as a web editor, editing stories and packaging them for online readers with punchy headlines good ledes. During my 5+ years there, I worked on social media strategy, audience engagement, setting up blogs, editing Wordpress styles, writing and aggregating stories, and even running our programmatic advertising. Then, last December, needing a change, I left the job with no plan except to pack up our possessions and drive to Arizona. </p>

            <p class="about">I'm a beginner at this. I'd done some CSS at my old job and some online classes, but this class has definitely humbled me. So I'm proud of every working line of code.
